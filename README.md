# Akshat-News-Project
 I developed a responsive website that fetches and displays real-time news using public APIs and/or web scraping. It shows the latest headlines and trending topics by category (e.g., sports, tech, politics). This project highlights my skills in API integration, async data handling, and full-stack web development.
